# `useTheme` Custom Hook

## Introduction

The `useTheme` custom hook offers a declarative way to manage and apply the theme within Telegram Mini Apps using the TMA.js SDK. It leverages `useThemeParams` from the SDK to get various theme parameters and applies them to your app.

## Features

- **Dynamic Theme Change**: Automatically switches between dark and light themes.
- **Primary Color Customization**: Allows you to set the primary button color.
- **Background Color Customization**: Allows you to set the background color of the app.

## Usage Example

Here's a simple example showing how to use the `useTheme` hook:

```javascript
import { useTheme } from '@/hooks/useTheme';

const MyApp = () => {
  useTheme();

  return (
    // Your app JSX
  );
};
```

## Code Details

The hook relies on the `useThemeParams` function provided by the TMA.js SDK. It performs the following:

- Sets CSS variables for the primary button color and background color.
- Sets a cookie named `theme` to remember the user's preferred theme (`dark` or `light`).
- Updates the `data-theme` attribute on the HTML tag based on the user's preferred theme.
