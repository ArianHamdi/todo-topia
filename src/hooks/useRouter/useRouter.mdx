# `useRouter` Hook

## Introduction

The `useRouter` custom hook provides a workaround to preserve the router query during page transitions within a Next.js application. This hook is specifically designed to enable smoothly page transition using framer-motion.

## Features

- **Query Preservation**: Retains the router query across different page transitions.

## Code Details

Here's a breakdown of how the hook works:

1. **Dependency on Next.js**: Utilizes `useRouter` from Next.js to get the router object.
2. **Local State**: Initializes a local state `query` to hold the router's query.
3. **Initialization**: Uses `useEffect` to set the `query` state once when the component mounts.
4. **Return Value**: Returns an object that spreads the original router object but overrides the `query` property with the local `query` state.

```javascript
// Snippet of implementation
export const useRouter = () => {
  const router = useNextRouter();
  const [query, setQuery] = useState(router.query);
  useEffect(() => {
    setQuery(router.query);
  }, []);
  return { ...router, query };
};
```

## Use Case

- To maintain query parameters when transitioning between pages in a Next.js application.
